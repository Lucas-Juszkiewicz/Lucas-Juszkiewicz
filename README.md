### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I am dedicating all my time to transitioning towards backend programming (Java, Spring Boot). 
In December 2023, I completed a two-month full-stack internship at Devbridge, 
which also allowed me to familiarize myself with the basics of frontend technologies (React).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Spring Boot.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Spring Boot projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: l.m.juszkiewicz@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: For the past 10 years, I have worked as an audio technician :)
